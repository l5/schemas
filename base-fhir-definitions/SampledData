To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.","items":{"$ref":"./Extension"},"type":"array"},"origin":{"description":"The base quantity that a measured value of zero represents.
