{"description":"Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a common context.  A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR, ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.","properties":{"id":{"description":"Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).

To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions.
